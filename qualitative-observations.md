## Qualitative observations

Below, I note qualitatively what I observe when running a single model configuration (2000 ticks, 200 fish) for each
strategy. I concentrate on both the individual behaviours of fish, as well as any group dynamics or emergent properties
of the strategy I observe.

### Mixed

**Individuals.** When the predator draws near, an individual seems to take relatively little action if the hunter
approaches from the front or back; if the predator instead emerges from one of the fish's sides, then it makes a
swift 90-degree turn around the predator.

**Fish schools.** Fish tend to turn to similar directions when the predator emerges from any side. Whether this can
be attributed to behavioural interactions among fish (due to flocking), or whether this simply is so because fish
follow the same strategy (and thus turn similarly, without any reliance on other fish for determining their direction)
is not fully clear.

## Solitary when nearby

**Individuals.** Individual fish always seem to turn 90 degrees from the threat. (This is to be expected: the fish
should do this both when the predator is close and when the predator is still at a distance; the difference between
the two is the stance towards flocking they take.)

**Fish schools.** It is difficult to see how this strategy is different from simply turning 90 degrees: even if
fish turn 90 degrees selfishly, fish around them take a similar turn, which causes the group to remain cohesive even
though they behave selfishly.

This strategy is perhaps only truly different from the turning 90 degrees strategy when
individual fish near the outskirts of a school get targeted. In those cases, only said fish flees selfishly while
the rest keeps flocking together. As a consequence, a fish 'chips off' from the group and keeps circling around the
predator until it gets eaten or until the predator gets distracted (by e.g. a different school) or confused.
